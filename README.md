# NPM package template

## Development

- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Run development server + build package on changes: `yarn dev`
  - Check `./package.json` for `dev` script. It runs dev commands for docusaurus and package concurrently.
  - Run only docusaurus dev server: `yarn workspace docs start`
  - Run only package build: `yarn workspace your-package-name dev`
    - Package is pre-configured to build out 2 dist paths:
      - `dist/index.*js` for vanilla JS exports
      - `dist/react.*js` for React exports
    - Docs has an example of importing an example `addNumber` export from `your-package-name` package in `getting-started.mdx`
